Intron retention
----------------
Intron retention (IR) is an alterntaive splicing (AS) form where
the intronic that separate the exonic components that make up
mature mRNA remain in the final transcript.  On the left below is
a figure of a pre-mRNA showing exons as shaded rectangles separated
by a single exon (black line).  On the right are two possible 
outcomes: 1) the intron remains, leading to an IR event or 2) the 
intron is spliced out, resulting in a constitutively spliced (CS) form.

Differential intron retention
-----------------------------
The figure below shows an example of differential intron
retention (IR). The top track shows a splice graph depiction
for the gene while the second and third tracks show read
depths for RNA-seq alignments from two different conditions.  
The areas
in red corresponds to the depths of the mRNA region detected
as a differential IR event.  While other introns exhibit some
level of expression, there exists insufficient evidence that these
introns are differentially retained.
